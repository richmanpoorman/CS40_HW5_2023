Phase 1: To pass this phase we input a string which exactly matches 
         the the string at address 0x401d50. Our string was
        "I was born with someone waiting to see me."

Phase 2: In this phase we input 6 numbers that satisfies the factorial
         algorithm to defuse the bomb. It is the factorial of each
         index from 1 to 6. So the solution is 1!, 2!, 3!, 4!, 5!, 6!
          
Phase 3: In this phase

Phase 4:

Phase 5: 

Phase 6: To solve this phase we pass a value at node0 so that when 
         fun6 sorts the linked list from largest to smallest, node0 
         is at the 3rd position. Fun6 sorts the linkedlist as:
         6->1->3->7->4->8->2->9->5 We need to add int value so that 
         node1: 816 < node0: 777 > node3: 685. Solved order: 
         6->1->0->3->7->4->8->2->9->5

Phase 7: To unlock the secret phase we need to input Igor_Straminksy 
         as a second input in phase 4. Then we
